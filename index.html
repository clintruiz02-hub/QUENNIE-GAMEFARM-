          <p> HISTORY OF QUEENIE GAME FARM </p> •Built on 2016,
            <p> The game farm started small. The owner first had only a few roosters in the backyard. He took care of them every day using basic ways. As time passed, he improved the cages, fed the birds better, and chose good roosters and hens to breed. Little by little, the farm grew bigger. Today, the game farm is known for strong and healthy birds because of the owner’s hard work.
              
              <p> FEATURE OF THE OWNER </p>
              Baldwin Navarro grew up loving animals, especially roosters. When he was young, he enjoyed watching older people take care of gamefowl, and he dreamed of having his own farm one day. When he became older, he finally started with just a few birds in his backyard.

Every morning, Baldwin woke up early to feed the birds and clean their cages. The work was tiring, but he enjoyed it. He paid close attention to the birds and learned how to raise them properly. Little by little, he improved his farm—building better cages and making sure the birds stayed healthy.

His small farm slowly grew. More people began to notice his hard work and the good quality of his birds. Baldwin stayed humble and continued to learn new ways to improve his farm.

Today, his game farm is known in his community. His story shows how someone with patience, dedication, and love for animals can turn a small dream into something real. Baldwin’s journey is simple but inspiring—he started small, worked hard, and never stopped improving.

As time passed, people noticed Baldwin’s effort. They saw that his birds were clean, healthy, and well-raised. More customers began to visit his farm, and many came back because they trusted him. Baldwin improved his cages, kept the farm organized, and slowly added more birds as the business grew.

His success did not come fast. It came from patience, daily work, and love for what he does. Today, Baldwin’s farm is known in the community because he stayed consistent and honest.

  <p> CHALLENGES </p>
Challenges Baldwin Faced

Baldwin faced many challenges while growing his farm. In the beginning, he did not have enough money to buy good cages and supplies, so he had to make do with what he had. Some days were hard because the weather affected the birds, and he needed to protect them from heat and rain. He also had to deal with sickness in the flock, which meant extra care and attention to keep the birds healthy.

Another challenge was time. Taking care of many animals every day was tiring, and Baldwin had to wake up early and sleep late just to finish all the tasks. He also needed to learn new things, and sometimes his plans didn’t work the way he expected.

Even with all these problems, Baldwin stayed patient. He used each challenge as a lesson and kept improving his farm step by step.              
                          
  <p> HOW WILL YOU SEE THE BUSINESS AFTER 10 YEARS</p>
            - after 10 years I see it as more stable and well-known. I believe my farm will be bigger, cleaner, and more organized, with better cages and healthier birds. I see more people trusting my business because of quality and honest work. I also see myself still learning and improving every year. After 10 years, I hope the business will continue to grow and support my family and community.

  <p> HOW DID THE GOVERNMENT HELP THE BUSINESS GROW? </p>
              -The government helped my business by giving advice and programs for small business owners. They shared knowledge on proper farming and safety. They also helped with rules and registration so the business could operate legally. With their help, the business became more stable and trusted.
